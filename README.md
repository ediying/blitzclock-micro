# blitzclock-micro

This is a Python script that connects your Raspiblitz Fullnode (LND) to a Blockclock micro and retrieves data about your Node. It uses that data to update a Blockclock micro, which displays the current Bitcoin block height, unconfirmed onchain transactions, lighning transactions and other relevant information. The update is performed every 5 minutes by a cronjob.

## Getting Started
